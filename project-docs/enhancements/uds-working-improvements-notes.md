# UDS Working Improvements — Notes (V1.0.0)

## Observation
Applying the footer template produced unexpectedly large text in the footer area.

## Expected Behavior
The footer should render as standard body text and be visually bounded by horizontal rules using triple dashes `---`.

## Verified Fix
- Source: `standard-document-footer-template.md`
- Standard Reference: UDS-006: Documentation Standards, Section 2.4 — “Standard Document Components”
- Key elements used:
  - Plain-text copyright line
  - ISO date for last updated
  - Clear status indicator (DRAFT, REVIEW, APPROVED, DEPRECATED)
  - Delimited with triple-dash lines above and below

## Example Footer Block
```

## Usage Guidelines
1. Place the footer at the end of the document.
2. Use a horizontal rule (triple dashes `---`) above and below the footer.
3. Include required elements:
   - Copyright (current year and organization)
   - Last updated date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - Document status (DRAFT/REVIEW/APPROVED/DEPRECATED)

## Source
- UDS-006: Documentation Standards, Section 2.4 — Standard Document Components
- Template file: `../standard-document-footer-template.md`

## Checklist
- Footer delimited with `---` lines
- Contains copyright, ISO date, and status
- Renders in normal text size (not heading)
- Placed at end of document only
- Validated against UDS‑006 requirements
