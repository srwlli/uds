## Usage Guidelines

1. **Horizontal Rules**
   - The header is enclosed by horizontal rules (triple dashes `---`)
   - This visually separates the header from the content

2. **Header Line Format**
   - Use H1 (single #) for the main header line
   - Include project name, version, and document type in a single line
   - Separate elements with vertical bars (|) for visual clarity
   - Keep project name consistent across related documents

3. **AI Assistance Note**
   - Include "Created with AI assistance" as an H2 line
   - This provides transparency about document creation methods

4. **Version Numbering**
   - Use X.Y.Z format (typically following semantic versioning)
   - Increment appropriately for changes

3. It includes the word "template" to indicate it's a reusable component
4. It uses the .md extension for markdown files
