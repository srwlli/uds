# Core Component Documentation Standards

## Purpose

To define how reusable software components—particularly in React, Vue, or similar frameworks—should be documented for clarity, testing, and integration.

## Scope

These standards apply to any system where code includes independently exportable UI or service components used across multiple views or modules.

## Component Spec Structure

Every component documentation file must include the following:

- **Component Name** (and purpose)
- **Props/Inputs Table**
  - Name
  - Type
  - Required
  - Default
  - Description
- **Behavior & Lifecycle**
  - Render logic
  - Interaction handling
  - Side effects
- **Code Example**
  - Minimal working use-case
  - Should include import and render
- **Variants**
  - Styles or behavioral variants (e.g., `compact`, `disabled`)
- **Accessibility Notes**
  - ARIA roles
  - Keyboard usage
  - Screen reader support

## Formatting Conventions

- All component docs should use level 2 headings (`##`) for major sections
- Props tables should conform to the UDS Table Standards
- Code examples must use triple-backtick fenced code blocks with language tags
