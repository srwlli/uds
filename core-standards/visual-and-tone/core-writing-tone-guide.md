# Writing Tone Guide

## Purpose

Maintain a consistent, professional tone across all UDS-compliant documentation.

---

## Required Tone Qualities

| Attribute | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Neutral | Avoid emotion, casual expressions, or marketing voice |
| Precise | Use technical, accurate language |
| Minimal | Say only what is needed; avoid filler |
| Structured | Follow standard UDS formatting rules |

---

## Language to Avoid

- Slang, emojis, or informal phrasing  
- “Wow”, “cool”, “awesome”, etc.  
- Symbols for emphasis (✅ ❌ ➜ ➕)

---

## Visual Tone Rule (Strict)

> Under strict compliance, **no emoji, decorative icons, or non-semantic visuals** may appear in any UDS doc — except for illustrative purposes in `core-visual-style-standards-strict.md`.

---

## Recommended Vocabulary

- Use clear, role-neutral terms: “function”, “process”, “document”, “output”  
- Avoid emotionally charged verbs or descriptions
